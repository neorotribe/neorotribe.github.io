It is almost like going on an auto-pilot mode. The mum's instinct to protect and fight for her child. </p><p>Looking back, those early years were a blur. They consist of intensive therapies, fingers crossing, huge disappointments but celebrations of little successes. If you ask me, I have become a better person in every way through the curve that was thrown at me. It has taught me patience, persistence, love, forgiveness and basically every difficult form of traits that one would rather not acquire. </p><p>I want to speak to the special needs parents specifically about forgiving yourself. I carried the guilt for a long time. The nudging feeling of guilt and self-blame. I was convinced Liam was autistic because I painted the house and inhaled the paint fumes (How ridiculous). I later on met an anti-vaxer lady that told me vaccinations causes autism and it is a conspiracy by the Australian government (Man that was an eventful day I never saw her again). </p><p>Does it matter really if we find out the reason why our child has autism? We will still love them and would fight for them. I have to forgive myself, for not doing enough, for doing too much, for being tired, for resenting, for wanting a normal family, for losing hope, for the past, for the present and for what is to come. </p><p>When we forgive ourselves, we allow hope to fill our hearts and this gives us energy for the future to fight. Self-care is not selfish, it is the highest form of love we can offer to ourselves and our family.</p><p>May you be kind to yourself today x</p><p> </p><p> </p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div
