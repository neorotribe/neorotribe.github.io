In their head, they are going for a holiday. And their idea of a holiday is staying in a fancy hotel watching TV (Because we doesn't have a TV in our home remember?). </p><p>I have been checking out Airbnb and accommodations for the past 2 weeks. Last year this time we were in Myola Jervis Bay, it was unforgettable. It certainly feels like a long time ago with all the Covid drama dragging out this year. Anyway, if you have done the same thing as me, you would soon realise that every accommodation up North and down South has been fully booked. Strangely, there are more options left in Sydney City. I guessed everyone just want to get out for abit.</p><p>Anyway, I have done some research and planning. For us, what works is getting out of home. A change of environment is good and we come back appreciating the comfort of our own home. Being out takes my focus and stress of keeping the house in order. </p><p>So there you go, 10 day trip ideas for Spring Break Holidays 2020. </p><p>1) Balmoral Beach, Mosman</p><p>Apart from Nicole Kidman frequently sighted there, we have found ourselves going back to Balmoral Beach again and again. It's the calm gentle waves the kids love. Invest in a good cabana, some beach chairs, pack a picnic and you are set to have the best day with your kids there. There's stuffs to do for young to the older kids. I have seen the older kids jumping off the jetty and it looks really fun.</p><p>2) <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://www.earlystartdiscoveryspace.edu.au/">Early Start Discovery Centre, University of Wollonggong </a></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/16/IMG_1159.HEIC" alt=""></figure>It is about 1.5 hour drive away from Sydney CBD. We were so impressed by the set up of the whole centre that we were honestly considering moving to Wolloggong for it. We spent the whole day there on our last trip and there was just endless stations of educational fun for all my kids. We held a year of membership for the whole family and it was worth our every cent of money. More on membership <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://www.earlystartdiscoveryspace.edu.au/visit/membership/">here</a>.<p></p><p>3) <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://www.treetops.com.au/">Treetop Adventure Park</a></p><p>We have gone to the location at Hills for twice now. Our first was on a Saturday dewy morning in Winter and second was to Liam's classmate birthday. It does require focus, coordination and certainly courage whenever they have to jump off the flying fox. I am looking forward to take Lily after she turns 3. Having all 3 kids on the obstacle course building their confidence is very fulfilling and relaxing for me. </p><p>4) <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://www.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/lifestyle/sports-and-recreation/parks-and-playgrounds/fagan-park">Fagan Park</a></p><p>We have gone to Fagan twice and we never quite been able to comb through the whole area. They have a great playground by the carpark and my kids love to ride their scooters on the trails around it. </p><p>5) <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://www.icentralcoast.com/somersby-falls.html">Somersby Falls</a></p><p>My good friend Sarah has been talking about Somersby Falls. I have yet to check it out but looking at the pictures, it is defo worth a visit. It will be on my to-do list this holidays.</p><p>6) <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/south-coast/jervis-bay-and-shoalhaven/huskisson/attractions/moona-moona-beach">Moona Moona Creek, Huskisson</a></p><p>Moona Moona Creek is a piece of paradise in South Coast of Sydney, Jervis Bay. It reminded me alot of Maldives' crystal clear water. We spent the whole day there and left the place very tanned and happy. This is one of the rare time I could not resist jumping into the water with the kids (Usually I just like to laze by the shore and leave the playing to Brandon ha).</p><p>7) Byron Bay</p><p>I have never been to Byron Bay but I have heard amazing stuffs about it. Apart from the fact that Chris Hemsworth and his massive estate, I read that Zac Efron has recently relocated there. There must be something about Byron Bay that has drawn the Hollywood celebrities to make it their home. We have yet stretched our stamina to driving 12 hours for a roadtrip but would keen to check out Byron Bay this year.</p><p>8) Canberra, ACT</p><p>Singaporeans would be very familiar with Canberra as the High Commission of Singapore is there. It is where we collect our Singapore passports. I do enjoy how sparse the city is. There are heaps of things for kids to do there. Questacon, Cockington Green Gardens, National Dinosaur Museum and our recent favourite is the National Arboretum Pod Playground. </p><p>9) Bilpin, NSW</p><p>Whenever I think about Bilpin, I would remember the daytrip where we brought my dad there. We meant to bring him to fruit-picking but the orchard was closed that day. We had a good time nonethless eating the famous Bilpin Apple Pie, visiting <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://bilpincider.com/">Bilpin Cider</a> and taking lots of photos. </p><p>10) Wisemen's Ferry</p><p>Wiseman’s Ferry is the oldest ferry crossing still in operation in New South Wales. It is our first time driving onto a ferry, and crossing the river. As the whole area is surrounded by National Parks, you can imagine how beautiful it is. There is something very rustic and inviting when you step foot beyond the ferry port. Definitely worth a day trip. Grab a lunch at Spencer Village Store, it is a quaint little town with friendly locals who treats you family and they serve a mean burger and coffee. </p><p> </p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 25 September 2020</p><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Fspring-break-ideas.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Fspring-break-ideas.html&amp;via=Neorotribe&amp;text=Spring%20Break%20Ideas%202020" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Spring%20Break%20Ideas%202020 https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Fspring-break-ideas.html" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/website/FA8C84AB-F536-41FC-BB9A-9E5E671435C9-3.JPG" loading="lazy" alt="June Ong" class="author__avatar"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/authors/june-ong/" class="invert" title="June Ong">June Ong</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://www.neorotribe.com/sydney-hills-horse-riding-centre.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Sydney Hills Horse Riding Centre</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article><div class="comments post__inner" id="comments"><h3 class="h5">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
