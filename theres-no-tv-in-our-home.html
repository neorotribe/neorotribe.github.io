But I am still learning how to hone it. Technology is like the infinity gauntlet with the stones (shoutout to Marvel fans), if you misuse it there will be consequences. <br><br>Back in 2012, Liam was a 2-year-old toddler. He was beyond fixated on the TV. When he was finally diagnosed with GDD (Global Developmental Delay), we were questioning if the overdose of screen time has led to the delays of all his skills. When we came to Sydney in 2016, we were exhausted in all forms. Having to deal with Liam's new diagnosis of autism and seeking to find a roadmap out of it. When we move into our first home here, we decided not to get a TV in the house. We were yearning for a change, we wanted to do more for our kids rather than propping them in front of the 'devils box'. <br><br>It was not a complete obsolete from screen time or technology in our household for the past few years. We still allow limited time of movies on the laptop from time to time. <br>But the whole conviction of pushing technology out of our system arose within the end of last year. The straw the broke the camel's back. Over the holidays, Liam had unlimited access to the games on the iPad. He finds comfort in the games he played because they are controlled regulated worlds. He was addicted to the stimulation and was unable to manage it for obvious reasons. He was angry, agitated and definitely disconnected. I knew that I had lost him and something drastic has to be done. <br>We got rid of the 3 iPads at the end of the holidays. We put Liam on a cold turkey. Initially, he was disengaged from his siblings and was extremely upset at us. Constantly lying by the side of the playground, feeling lethargic and irritated. Activities that he used to enjoy like reading books or playing in the back were no longer stimulating enough for him. It was a dark week for all of us.  I remembered telling Brandon if he ever brings back an iPad into the house again, I will not hesitate to set it on fire.<br><br>Do I hate technology? No. It is just so happens in our case, we have to thread carefully. Before our kids have mastered the ability of self-control, we are in control of their access. We know that in time to come, they will dive into them with no return. So as long and as much possible, we want quality time with them. </p><hr><p>Photo by Eric Yip @ https://eyxl.com.au/</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on September 23, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Ftheres-no-tv-in-our-home.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Ftheres-no-tv-in-our-home.html&amp;via=%40neorotribe&amp;text=There's%20no%20Teevee" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><img class="u-author__avatar" src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/website/FA8C84AB-F536-41FC-BB9A-9E5E671435C9-3.JPG" loading="lazy" alt="June Ong"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/authors/june-ong/" title="June Ong">June Ong</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/lets-rewild-ourselves.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Let&#x27;s Rewild Ourselves</h5></div><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/2/responsive/liam-jumping-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box featured"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured__container"><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/spring-break-ideas.html" class="featured__image-link"><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_8174-xs.PNG" alt=""></a><div><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/spring-break-ideas.html" class="featured__title">School&#x27;s Out, Holiday&#x27;s in!</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-09-24T18:02">September 24, 2020</time></div></li></ul></section><section class="box u-ads"><h3 class="u-ads__title">Advertisement</h3></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Follow us</h3><div class="follow"><a href="www.facebook.com/neorotribe" class="facebook" aria-label="Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> Facebook </a><a href="www.twitter.com/neorotribe" class="twitter" aria-label="Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> Twitter </a><a href="www.instagram.com/ne0rotribe" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> Instagram</a></div></section><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">About Us</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/authors/june-ong/" class="authors__image-link"><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/website/FA8C84AB-F536-41FC-BB9A-9E5E671435C9-3.JPG" alt="June Ong"></a><div><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/authors/june-ong/" class="authors__title">June Ong</a></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/reviews/">Reviews</a> <span class="u-small">(4)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://www.neorotribe.com/"><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/website/logo.png" alt="Neorotribe"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="www.facebook.com/neorotribe" aria-label="Facebook"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="www.twitter.com/neorotribe" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="www.instagram.com/ne0rotribe" aria-label="Instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright Neorotribe 2020</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
