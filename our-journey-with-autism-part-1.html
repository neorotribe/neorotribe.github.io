I will include our experiences in dealing with the landscape of both Singapore and Australia's special needs support. I hoped this series of posts on our experiences would shine a light on autism and be helpful in some ways.</p><p>I am careful to talk about Liam as I do not want to invade into his privacy or overstep his consent. My concern is not to leave any permanent digital footprint about him without him truly understanding the ramifications of it. Having to say that, I am happy to take it offline with any parents should you have any similar concern about your child. </p><p>I have had a normal and healthy pregnancy. If anything I gained too much weight. I was an oversized dinosaur waddling when I was into my 3rd trimester. The delivery was long but it was alright. I have filled up hundreds of forms regarding Liam's diagnosis and they always ask similar questions if the pregnancy and delivery were normal.</p><p>Liam was a happy baby and toddler. He has had developmental delays but we chalked it to the fact that boys usually develop later than girls. When he was 2, he started to have uncontrollable meltdowns. Looking back, it was a combination of the fact that he wasn't able to express himself (as he was non-verbal at the time), and he wasn't able to cope with the sensory overloads. We were really helpless and isolated because in the asian culture, there is a strong stigma of having a child with mental disability. </p><p>He was diagnosed when he was 4. We waited 1.5 year for early intervention support but it was taking too long for us. We were not equipped to help him and our daily life was beyond stressful. We tried 2 preschools and they could not cope with him. Those were really dark days because nothing we do seems to help him at all. It was very stressful in Singapore because we find that there was a lack of empathy and understanding at that point. This was about 6 years ago. I would like to to believe Singapore has progressed in this aspect. </p><p>The turning point truly came for us when we relocated to Sydney, Australia. We received funding for his therapy from the government and there were endless options of support for his well-being here. I had to change my perspective from having no support to picking the suitable one for him. We had an intensive year of therapies ranging from psychology, behavioural, speech and occupational. They were essential to help him to be independent and cope with life. </p><p>He has come on leaps and bounds. We have had many people who told us that they cannot tell that Liam has autism. I am not so sure about that statement. Autism is an invisible disability. It can actually work for and against him. I will elaborate on this on my following posts.</p><p>Singapore parents who are struggling with their children on the autism spectrum and finding it difficult in Singapore, please do not think that relocating to other countries is the only solution. The whole world has moved into teleconferencing and online communication due to Covid. You can access to any training or therapy not limited to what Singapore provides. Moreover, it is about finding the right therapy, providing a safe and consistent environment for your child. As parents progress, children progresses too. </p><p>I am including some objective helpful readings if you suspect your child has autism. I can't stress enough how important it is not to get into non-mainstream ideas like curing autism through diet, being anti-vax and so on. Don't be taken on a ride. They usually sell you the idea of hope. Accept your child for who he or she is. This is the first step to finding light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>Please reach out and I will be happy to give more information from our experiences.</p><p>Sending you light and love
