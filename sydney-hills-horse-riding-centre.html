We are close to every possible option of outdoor activity. I have often meet parents who either has horses as pets or their kids riding as a hobby. There is also much traction on equine therapy, how horses are used as a form of therapy for autistic children. </p><p>The funniest thing was, Brandon has nearly been killed by a horse. When he was 14, a horse riding accident left him hanging for life at the edge of a cliff in a quarry. That's heaps of drama within a sentence. I carried the perspective of how a horse can be erratic and dangerous from his experience. </p><p>But you know me, I have to be convinced with my own experience. I never settled with a hearsay. Our belief as parents is to allow our children to grow from different kind of experiences. So getting our kids to take up horse riding is an inevitable thing. I am also secretly hoping through the kids, Brandon would find closure with his traumatic incident.</p><p>We booked in a 30 mins session for Lily. We were told that children grow with the horses. Lily was very easy and engaging. She was given a crash course on brushing and saddling Cloud, the shetland pony. It was more on getting Lily to be comfortable around him. I was a little concerned with Lily's eczema flare as Cloud was massively shedding. Apparently horses grow thick coats during Winter and shed them coming Spring and Summer. How amazing is nature.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/IMG_8986.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_8986-xs.jpeg 300w, https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_8986-sm.jpeg 480w, https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_8986-md.jpeg 768w" alt="" width="1000" height="1334"><figcaption>Nicole putting the helmet on Lily</figcaption></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/IMG_8984.jpeg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_8984-xs.jpeg 300w, https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_8984-sm.jpeg 480w, https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/responsive/IMG_8984-md.jpeg 768w" alt="" width="1024" height="1366"><figcaption>Lily bringing the reins</figcaption></figure><p>The owner Carolyn took over the second half of the lesson. We saddled Lily on Cloud and went for a ride around the vicinity. Lily was taught how to move and stop Cloud. I must say within the 30 mins, Lily has had a good first lesson. She was really exhausted by the end of it. We were quite happy with how it all turned out. </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/Lily-Horse-Riding.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/responsive/Lily-Horse-Riding-xs.jpg 300w, https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/responsive/Lily-Horse-Riding-sm.jpg 480w, https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/15/responsive/Lily-Horse-Riding-md.jpg 768w" alt="Lily enjoying a trot" width="2032" height="1524"><figcaption>Lily enjoying a trot with Carolyn</figcaption></figure><p>We have signed both Liam and Levi for their <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://www.sydneyhillshorseriding.com/school-holiday-camps">holiday camps</a> coming in Oct. It would be really interested to see how it would pen out for Liam because he can not tolerate strong smell. Perhaps the calming effect or a budding love for a horse could help him overcome his sensory irregularities. </p><p>Sydney Hills Horse Riding Centre is in the midst of getting approval to become an NDIS provider. This is a piece of good news as this would mean special needs family in Hills District would enjoy the close proximity to the centre. </p><p>What I love about them is their horses enjoy 2-3 days of break in the week. This commitment of caring for their horses would definitely transcend in the service and work they do. This is something we want to instil in our children, caring for their environment, nature and animals. </p><hr><p>Sydney Hills Horse Riding Centre</p><div id="1125808489" class="u_1125808489 sectionContactBox"><div>Address: 66 Kenthurst Road</div><div>Dural, 2158</div><div>NSW, Australia </div><div>Phone: 0421 218983</div><div> </div><div> </div></div></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 24 September 2020</p><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Fsydney-hills-horse-riding-centre.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Fsydney-hills-horse-riding-centre.html&amp;via=Neorotribe&amp;text=Sydney%20Hills%20Horse%20Riding%20Centre" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Sydney%20Hills%20Horse%20Riding%20Centre https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Fsydney-hills-horse-riding-centre.html" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/website/FA8C84AB-F536-41FC-BB9A-9E5E671435C9-3.JPG" loading="lazy" alt="June Ong" class="author__avatar"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/authors/june-ong/" class="invert" title="June Ong">June Ong</a></h3></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://www.neorotribe.com/our-journey-with-autism-part-2.html" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Our journey with Autism (Part 2)</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article><div class="comments post__inner" id="comments"><h3 class="h5">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
