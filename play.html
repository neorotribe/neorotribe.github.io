Which kid doesn't? Unfortunately between play and having screen time, they would gladly choose the latter. <p></p><p>This is why Brandon and I are huge advocates at providing the environment for them to play. We are not big on accumulating toys and are minimalists by nature. So at any one time in the house, there is only a set of toy and activity. At this moment it's LEGO. We would never say no to books so they are everywhere in our home. </p><p>We are very fortunate to have a yard in our home. The trampoline has been a daily routine for my kids. We recently added a cubby because the kids had bugged us for the past year for a treehouse. We don't have a tree and the cubby is the next best thing. We chose a big cubby as Liam could not fit into a toddler's one anymore. We hoped it would serve as a hideout and probably even a kiddy flat for them. </p><p>My kids understand the drill in the house. They would usually get out and play themselves. Unless there is a fight incident among them, they can go on for hours. I have also trained myself to resist helping them with their boredom. I have never gave in to them when they come to me and say they are bored. They have a million things to do if they dig deep into their imagination. And usually after some time, they would find something to do. </p><p>It takes practice for both you and your children to get into the routine. I never like placing my kids in front of a TV. They are losing precious time with each other bonding and making memories. I let them get dirty and messy in the yard. There is so much the great outdoors could offer to both the kids and adults. </p><p>This is why I love being in the garden, working the lawn or caring for the plants. It does my soul so so good. My kids are also much calmer when they get to play in the sun and get some fresh air.</p><p>Rewild and rewire yourself with your own family culture. It is a little tweak but it would bring so much happiness in the long run. Try it.</p><hr><p>Photo by Eric Yip @ https://eyxl.com.au/</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on September 23, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Fplay.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neorotribe.com%2Fplay.html&amp;via=%40neorotribe&amp;text=Play" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><img class="u-author__avatar" src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/website/FA8C84AB-F536-41FC-BB9A-9E5E671435C9-3.JPG" loading="lazy" alt="June Ong"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/authors/june-ong/" title="June Ong">June Ong</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/lets-rewild-ourselves.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/2/responsive/liam-jumping-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Let&#x27;s Rewild Ourselves</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/authenticity-happiness.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Authenticity &#x3D; Happiness</h5></div><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/4/responsive/Neobabies-2-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box featured"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured__container"><li class="featured__item"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/spring-break-ideas.html" class="featured__image-link"><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_8174-xs.PNG" alt=""></a><div><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/spring-break-ideas.html" class="featured__title">School&#x27;s Out, Holiday&#x27;s in!</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2020-09-24T18:02">September 24, 2020</time></div></li></ul></section><section class="box u-ads"><h3 class="u-ads__title">Advertisement</h3></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Follow us</h3><div class="follow"><a href="www.facebook.com/neorotribe" class="facebook" aria-label="Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> Facebook </a><a href="www.twitter.com/neorotribe" class="twitter" aria-label="Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> Twitter </a><a href="www.instagram.com/ne0rotribe" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> Instagram</a></div></section><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">About Us</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/authors/june-ong/" class="authors__image-link"><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/website/FA8C84AB-F536-41FC-BB9A-9E5E671435C9-3.JPG" alt="June Ong"></a><div><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/authors/june-ong/" class="authors__title">June Ong</a></div></li></ul></section><section class="box"><h3 class="box__title">Tags</h3><ul class="tags"><li><a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/reviews/">Reviews</a> <span class="u-small">(4)</span></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://www.neorotribe.com/"><img src="https://www.neorotribe.com/media/website/logo.png" alt="Neorotribe"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__follow"><a href="www.facebook.com/neorotribe" aria-label="Facebook"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="www.twitter.com/neorotribe" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="www.instagram.com/ne0rotribe" aria-label="Instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.neorotribe.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright Neorotribe 2020</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
