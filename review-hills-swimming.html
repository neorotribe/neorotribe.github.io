So far we have been extremely surprised by the wide array of quality providers of kids' activities, cafes, parks, amenities and all. <p></p><p>Swimming is a lifeskill so it is compulsory in our family. It was tricky for us to find the right one as Liam was having difficulties in a group swimming setting before. Our current challenge is to find a swimming place that can accommodate our 3 kids level and timing. </p><p>We pulled the kids out of all their activities when the world came to an end in March (Feels like it in my part of the world!). </p><p>At this unprecedented season, there is a certain sense of heightened cautiousness and fear when we send our kids back to their usual activities. My aim is to provide an insight on how well a place or provider is adhering to the covidsafe rules and regulations. This will provide you a peace of mind and let you know what to expect when you visit the place.</p><p>Today marks the first time Lily is swimming. I was really impressed when we stepped into the vicinity. Entry and Exit were marked clearly at the door. You would hit the sanitiser station first and staff will take both yours and your child's temperature. You will then be directed to leave your details for contact tracing. The process was without dramas even though I had Lily with me. Perhaps it would be a different story with the boys.</p><p>All the ground staffs were wearing masks and the swimming instructors in the pool were wearing a plastic shield. All the seatings were spaced out which is a relief. The pool do get a little crowded at some point but I do feel safe because I could smell the sanitiser in both seating and pool area. I must say the staffs has taken effort to be warm and engaging despite wearing the masks. </p><p>It is really hard to be running a local business providing service at this Covid season. Everyone is trying their best to make it work. I do appreciate the fact that I can send my children in to continue their swimming activity in a safe and protected environment.</p><p>For this I would give Hills Swimming a 5/5 rating as a covidsafe provider. This is on top of their excellent swimming curriculum which has stood the rest of time for many Hills district parents over the years.</p><p>For more information on Hills Swimming, you can click <a href="https://www.neorotribe.com/review-hills-swimming.html#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" title="https://www.hillsswimming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
